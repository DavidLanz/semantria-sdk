CHANGELOG

3.9.2 - Added support of Vertical packs feature.
	- Supported vertical packs returned as part of supported features (GetSupportedFeatures method).
	- Verticall packs allowed for the current subscription can be retrieved using GetSubscription method.
	- Added new CloneConfiguration method for easy clonning of vertical packs.

3.9.1 - Initial version of .NET SDK for .Net framework 4.5 with dynamic objects support.
	- .NET 4.5 SDK is much less than original one because strong-typed classes are not needed any-more.
	- All kind of output deserializes on the fly to dynamic (run-time) objects.
